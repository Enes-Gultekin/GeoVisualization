Overview

The repository is aimed to visualise geodata using various geovisualization techniques, including visualization methods, classifications, animations, cartographic and thematic analysis, and statistical methods.

Software and Tools: Hands-on experience with QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, and web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive maps. Design Principles: Focus on effective map design and user interaction to ensure visualizations are informative, engaging, and user-friendly. The projects include analyses and visualizations related to IKEA store locations, volcanic activity, traffic accidents in NRW, and more.

Projects:

IKEA Stores Distance Analysis Objective: Analyze the distribution and accessibility of IKEA stores in Germany. Methodology: Utilized GIS tools to calculate distances from IKEA stores to the nearest motorway nodes. Key Findings: The average distance of IKEA stores to motorway nodes is 1315.85 meters, with Berlin-Waltersdorf being the closest and Berlin-Lichtenberg the farthest1.

Cruise Objective: The project aims to visualize the cruise of the POLARBJORN ship during the CEAREX drift operations in the Arctic region1. Methodology: importing Coordinated CEAREX Data and calculating distances using both Cartesian and Ellipsoidal methods to accurately visualize the POLARBJORN shipâ€™s drift operations during the CEAREX experiment. Volcanoes Objective: Visualize volcanic activity and its impact on surrounding areas. Methodology: Mapped volcanic eruptions and analyzed their geographical distribution.

Accidents in NRW Objective: Study the spatial distribution of traffic accidents in North Rhine-Westphalia. Methodology: Used spatial analysis techniques to identify accident hotspots and patterns.

Flood Analysis Objective: Assess flood risks and visualize flood-prone areas. Methodology: Combined hydrological data with GIS to map flood zones.

RUSLE Project Objective: Assess the extent of soil erosion over time. Provide insights for sustainable land management and agricultural practices. Methodology: Evaluating the impact of different land uses on soil erosion and identifying erosion hotspots.
