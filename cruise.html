        The CEAREX drift operations used the ship POLARBJORN as a scientific
        base. During early September 1988, the POLARBJORN made its way into a
        region of multiyear pack ice north of Svalbard with icebreaker support
        from the U.S. Coast Guard NORTHWIND. The POLARBJORN was allowed to
        freeze into the ice on September 16 at 82 degrees 41 minutes north, 32
        degrees 26 minutes east. The ship was relatively immobile and drifted
        slowly southeastward with the ice pack toward Viktoriya Island, then
        southwestward past Kvitoya Island, and finally into the Barents Sea.
        The large ice floe (Alpha Floe) to which the POLARBJORN was moored was
        used as a drifting data collection platform until 15 November, when
        strong northwesterly winds destroyed the ice floe just northwest of
        Kvitoya. At this time, equipment was brought aboard and an attempt was
        made to return to Tromso, Norway. After several days of limited
        progress, 16 of the 20 scientists were airlifted to Spitsbergen on
        December 12. A strong storm in early January allowed the POLARBJORN to
        break free and return to Tromso on 9 January 1989. All drift
        operations were completed by mid-January 1989, and the ship operated
        in the Fram Strait and Barents Sea areas from late January until May
        1989.

    <article><p><h3>Cartesian Distance:</h3>
      Assumption: Measures distance on a flat, two-dimensional plane.
      Calculation: Uses the Pythagorean theorem to calculate straight-line distances between points.
      Use Case: Often used in small-scale maps or local surveys where the curvature of the Earth is negligible.
      <h3>Ellipsoidal Distance: </h3>
      Assumption: Measures distance on the curved surface of an ellipsoid, which is a more accurate representation of the Earth’s shape.
      Calculation: Takes into account the Earth’s curvature and uses geodetic methods to calculate distances.
      Use Case: Used in large-scale maps, global navigation, and geodesy where the Earth’s curvature cannot be ignored.
